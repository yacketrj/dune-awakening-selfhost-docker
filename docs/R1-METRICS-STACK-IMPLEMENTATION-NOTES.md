# R1 Metrics Stack MVP Implementation Notes

Tracking issue: #82
Branch: `feature/metrics`
PR: #83

## Summary

R1 adds the first opt-in operational metrics stack for Dune Docker Console.

Implemented components:

- `docker-compose.metrics.yml`
- `runtime/metrics/prometheus.yml`
- `runtime/metrics/rules/host.yml`
- `runtime/metrics/rules/containers.yml`
- `runtime/metrics/rules/postgres.yml`
- `runtime/metrics/rules/rabbitmq.yml`
- `runtime/metrics/rules/dune-stack.yml`
- `runtime/scripts/metrics-stack.sh`
- `runtime/scripts/metrics-status.sh`
- `dune metrics ...` CLI dispatch in `runtime/scripts/dune`

## Why

The project needs industry-standard operational metrics for host, container, RabbitMQ, and Postgres health without forcing gameplay KPI analytics into Prometheus.

This first release phase creates the independent metrics control plane while keeping the Dune game stack unchanged.

## Operational Design

The metrics stack is opt-in and starts separately from the game stack:

```text
dune metrics start
dune metrics stop
dune metrics restart
dune metrics status
dune metrics logs [service]
dune metrics config
dune metrics pull
```

Prometheus binds to localhost only by default:

```text
127.0.0.1:9090
```

Exporters are attached to the existing internal `dune-net` network and are not published publicly by default.

Metrics compose now uses a separate project name by default:

```text
${DUNE_COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME:-dune-awakening-selfhost-docker}-metrics
```

This prevents metrics compose operations from warning that the main game/web containers are orphaned.

## Metrics Stack Components

```text
dune-prometheus
dune-node-exporter
dune-cadvisor
dune-postgres-exporter
```

Prometheus also scrapes existing RabbitMQ containers when they are running:

```text
dune-rmq-admin:15692
dune-rmq-game:15692
```

## Prometheus Jobs

```text
dune-prometheus
dune-node
dune-cadvisor
dune-postgres
dune-rabbitmq-admin
dune-rabbitmq-game
```

## Alert Rule Groups

```text
dune-host
dune-containers
dune-postgres
dune-rabbitmq
dune-stack
```

The `dune-stack` rule file is currently a valid empty rule group. It is reserved for R2 console-exporter metrics.

## Security Notes

Security posture for R1:

- Metrics stack remains opt-in.
- Prometheus binds to `127.0.0.1` by default.
- node_exporter is not public.
- cAdvisor is not public.
- postgres_exporter is not public.
- RabbitMQ metrics are scraped on the internal Docker network.
- No passwords or tokens are committed.
- postgres_exporter uses environment-derived credentials, not Git-tracked literal secrets.
- No player identifiers or gameplay labels are emitted in R1.

## Validation Result: 2026-06-30, initial run

Local validation was run from:

```text
/home/darkdante/dune-clean-repro
```

Commands run:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.metrics.yml config
bash runtime/scripts/metrics-stack.sh config
bash runtime/scripts/metrics-stack.sh start
bash runtime/scripts/metrics-stack.sh status
bash runtime/scripts/metrics-stack.sh stop
bash runtime/scripts/dune metrics status
```

Observed results:

- Compose config rendered successfully.
- Prometheus started and reported healthy on `127.0.0.1:9090`.
- cAdvisor started.
- postgres_exporter started.
- node_exporter failed to start under WSL/Docker mount propagation.
- Stack stopped cleanly afterward.
- Post-stop status correctly reported Prometheus unreachable.

Failure:

```text
Error response from daemon: path / is mounted on / but it is not a shared or slave mount
```

Root cause:

`dune-node-exporter` originally mounted the host root as:

```text
/:/host:ro,rslave
```

That propagation mode is common in Linux host examples, but it fails when the Docker host root mount is not configured as shared/slave. This is common in WSL/Docker Desktop environments.

Fix applied:

```text
/:/host:ro
```

The node exporter host root mount is still read-only, but no longer requires `rslave` propagation by default.

## Validation Result: 2026-06-30, retest after mount fix

Command run:

```bash
bash runtime/scripts/metrics-stack.sh start
```

Observed results:

- Metrics compose started all four containers.
- Prometheus started and exposed `127.0.0.1:9090`.
- cAdvisor started.
- node_exporter started.
- postgres_exporter started.
- Prometheus health reported `healthy`.

Container status:

```text
dune-prometheus          Up 2 seconds                      127.0.0.1:9090->9090/tcp
dune-cadvisor            Up 2 seconds (health: starting)   8080/tcp
dune-node-exporter       Up 2 seconds                      9100/tcp
dune-postgres-exporter   Up 2 seconds                      9187/tcp
```

Remaining issue observed:

- The status command printed the `=== Prometheus targets ===` header but no target rows.

Conclusion:

- Container startup and Prometheus health are now passing.
- Empty target output is not a complete validation pass. Prometheus should report active scrape targets for the configured jobs.

Fix applied after this observation:

- `metrics-stack.sh` now waits briefly for Prometheus targets after `start` and `restart`.
- `metrics-stack.sh status` now prints `active_targets=<count>`.
- Empty target output now renders an explicit message instead of silently passing.
- Metrics compose now uses a separate project name and ignores orphan warnings from the main game/web stack.

## Validation Result: 2026-06-30, retest after target reporting fix

User-reported local result:

- Metrics stack is running.
- Prometheus shows configured targets.
- Prometheus shows loaded rules.

Conclusion:

- Prometheus startup is validated.
- Compose service startup is validated after the node exporter mount fix.
- Prometheus scrape target loading is validated.
- Prometheus rule loading is validated.
- The previous blank target output issue is resolved.

RabbitMQ note:

- RabbitMQ scrape jobs may appear down if the game RabbitMQ containers are not running.
- RabbitMQ endpoint health should be validated with `dune-rmq-admin` and `dune-rmq-game` running before closing all R1 runtime validation.

## Recommended Additional Checks

Prometheus API checks:

```bash
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:9090/-/healthy
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:9090/api/v1/targets
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:9090/api/v1/rules
```

Optional metric-level checks:

```bash
curl -fsS 'http://127.0.0.1:9090/api/v1/query?query=up'
curl -fsS 'http://127.0.0.1:9090/api/v1/query?query=pg_up'
```

Expected always-present jobs:

```text
dune-prometheus
dune-node
dune-cadvisor
dune-postgres
```

RabbitMQ jobs are expected only when the relevant RabbitMQ containers and Prometheus plugin endpoints are reachable.

## Regression Expectations

R1 should not alter normal game startup behavior.

Regression checks:

```bash
bash runtime/scripts/dune --help
bash runtime/scripts/dune status
bash runtime/scripts/dune ready
bash runtime/scripts/dune ps
```

Full game-stack runtime validation remains required before marking R1 complete.

## Remaining R1 Work

- Confirm RabbitMQ `15692` endpoints are reachable from Prometheus on `dune-net` when RabbitMQ is running.
- Confirm postgres_exporter reports `pg_up == 1` against the active `.env` credentials.
- Confirm cAdvisor transitions from `health: starting` to healthy under WSL/Docker Desktop host constraints.
- Run regression checks for normal game-stack CLI commands.
- Run security/static checks before marking PR ready for review.
