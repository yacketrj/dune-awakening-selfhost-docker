# Dune Discord Companion Bot - Project Status

## Current Status

The Discord companion bot is in an experimental read-only integration phase.

The current implementation validates the protected Console adapter path and the bot command layer without enabling any write, destructive, database mutation, Docker control, or addon mutation behavior.

| Bot API token auth | Complete | Adapter route tests |
| Discord actor authorization | Complete | Policy and route tests |
| Public redacted status | Complete | Status provider tests |
| Detailed redacted status | Complete | Admin-only diagnostic tests |
| Readiness route | Complete | Adapter and provider tests |
| Services route | Complete | Adapter and provider tests |
| Bot command smoke runner | Complete | `discord-bot/scripts/command-smoke.mjs` |
| No-write bot capability model | Complete | `discord-bot/src/security/authorization.ts` |
| Secret scanning | Complete | `discord-bot/scripts/check-secrets.mjs` |
| SOC 2 readiness matrix | Complete | `docs/discord-control-bot/soc2-control-matrix.md` |
| Scheduled SOC 2 readiness check | Complete | `.github/workflows/soc2-readiness-check.yml` |

## Current Live Routes

| Route | Role Requirement | Purpose | Write Capable |
|---|---:|---|---:|
| `GET /api/integrations/discord/health` | Bot API token | Adapter health and role-policy status | No |
| `POST /api/integrations/discord/status` | Public for normal mode; Admin for diagnostic mode | Public redacted status or detailed redacted status | No |
| `POST /api/integrations/discord/readiness` | Observer | Server readiness summary | No |
| `POST /api/integrations/discord/services` | Observer | Friendly service summary | No |

## Current Bot Commands

| Command | Minimum Role | Output |
|---|---:|---|
| `/dune health` | Public | Adapter health |
| `/dune status` | Public | Public redacted status output |
| `/dune status detail` | Admin | Detailed redacted diagnostic output |
| `/dune readiness` | Observer | Readiness summary |
| `/dune services` | Observer | Service summary |

## Validation Status

Latest local validation reported:

- Console Discord adapter tests: 37 passing, 0 failing.
- Bot tests: 3 passing, 0 failing.
- Bot secret scan: passing after runtime-assembled redaction fixtures.
- Bot scaffold validation: passing after narrowing validation to capability literals.
- Live HTTP checks: status, readiness, services, and detailed status returned `200 OK` with matching role policy.

## Roadmap

### P0 - Foundation and Governance

Status: mostly complete.

Completed items include the isolated bot workspace, security gates, redaction tests, authorization tests, protected adapter docs, SOC 2 readiness matrix, scheduled readiness workflow, and setup/admin/user documentation.

### P1 - Read-Only Operational Visibility

Status: in progress.

Completed:

- Health.
- Public redacted status.
- Admin detailed redacted status.
- Readiness.
- Services.

Remaining:

- Population summary.
- Logs with cap/redaction/role gate.
- Map state.
- Backup list/latest metadata.
- Real Discord client connection and slash command registration.

### P2 - Operational Hardening

Status: not started.

Planned:

- Rate limits.
- Alerting.
- Bot heartbeat.
- Public/admin channel mapping.
- Emergency disable flag.
- Evidence retention policy.

### P3 - Future Review Gate

Status: blocked by design.

No write, destructive, credential, database mutation, addon mutation, player mutation, map mutation, or Docker/service lifecycle command may be added without a separate threat model, approval, DAST cases, audit policy, and rollback plan.

## SOC 2 Readiness Position

This project maintains SOC 2-aligned readiness evidence. It does not claim SOC 2 certification or produce a SOC 2 report. A formal SOC 2 report requires an independent CPA examination.

The recurring readiness workflow checks documentation, safety markers, tests, secret scanning, and scaffold validation on a weekly cadence and on relevant repository changes.
