# Web Security

The web admin has host and game-server control power. Treat it as an admin-only local operations surface.

## Authentication

- The API uses a local admin password and secure session cookie.
- State-changing requests require a CSRF token from the authenticated session.
- `AUTH_DISABLED=true` is allowed only for local development.
- Login and logout are audit logged.

## Command Safety

All command execution must use the safe command runner:

- no arbitrary shell commands from the frontend
- no dynamic `sh -c`
- allowlisted RedBlink operations only
- validate service names, player IDs, item IDs, map names, backup names, filenames, and paths
- enforce timeouts
- redact secrets from stdout/stderr/task logs
- write audit entries for high-risk operations

Allowed command families are RedBlink `runtime/scripts/dune` operations and narrowly scoped Docker inspection/control where needed.

## Direct Database Safety

Direct Postgres features must:

- discover connection details from the RedBlink Docker/runtime environment
- use parameterized queries where available
- validate schema/table names against database metadata
- create a backup before destructive mutations unless an existing safe RedBlink command already does so
- require explicit confirmation for destructive SQL
- support read-only mode
- redact secrets and sensitive tokens from logs

## RabbitMQ Safety

RabbitMQ live commands must:

- use known RedBlink game/admin exchange and routing details only
- validate target player/account IDs
- audit every broadcast, whisper, kick, item grant, teleport, or live command
- avoid exposing a generic message publisher to the browser

Phase 4 web actions use the existing RedBlink `dune admin` CLI for RabbitMQ-backed live commands. The web API does not expose a generic RabbitMQ publisher. Broadcast, shutdown broadcast, and whisper currently return explicit unsupported capability responses because their RedBlink RabbitMQ wire path is not yet implemented in the local CLI.

Destructive live actions require backend confirmation phrases in addition to frontend confirmation:

- kick all online: `KICK ALL ONLINE PLAYERS`
- clean inventory: `CLEAN INVENTORY`
- reset progression: `RESET PROGRESSION`
- inventory delete: `DELETE INVENTORY ITEM` before returning its current unsupported response
- storage give item: `GIVE ITEM TO STORAGE` before returning its current unsupported response
- shutdown broadcast: `SHUTDOWN BROADCAST` before returning its current unsupported response

## Docker Socket Risk

Container mode may require mounting `/var/run/docker.sock`. That grants broad control over the host Docker daemon. Documentation and compose comments must warn that this is powerful and should be exposed only to trusted admins.

## Host Bootstrap

Host-level bootstrap such as Docker installation is disabled by default.

If `ALLOW_HOST_BOOTSTRAP=true` is set:

- every command must be displayed before execution
- explicit confirmation is required
- Ubuntu/Debian must be supported first
- unsupported systems must show manual instructions only

## Audit Log

Audit logging is required for:

- login/logout
- setup/config changes
- start/stop/restart
- updates
- backup/restore/import/delete
- admin player actions
- SQL execution
- file upload/download/restore
- RabbitMQ live commands
