Dune Docker Console is a Docker-based self-hosting package for Dune: Awakening with a built-in browser admin panel. Install it on a fresh server, open the Web UI, finish setup in the wizard, and manage players, maps, backups, updates, live tools, and server operations without living in the terminal.

This project is unofficial. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, sponsored by, or supported by Funcom.

## Discord Companion Bot Status

The `feature/discord-control-bot` branch includes an experimental read-only Discord companion bot and a protected Console API adapter.

Current implemented commands and smoke-tested routes:

| Command | Role | Status |
|---|---:|---|
| `/dune health` | Public | Implemented through adapter health |
| `/dune status` | Public | Implemented with redacted public output |
| `/dune status detail` | Admin/Owner | Implemented with detailed redacted output |
| `/dune readiness` | Observer+ | Implemented |
| `/dune services` | Observer+ | Implemented |

The bot is intentionally read-only. It does not expose write, destructive, database mutation, player mutation, backup restore/delete, Docker control, addon mutation, or broadcast commands.

Discord companion documentation:

- `docs/discord-control-bot/project-status.md`
- `docs/discord-control-bot/setup-guide.md`
- `docs/discord-control-bot/admin-guide.md`
- `docs/discord-control-bot/user-guide.md`
- `docs/discord-control-bot/roadmap.md`
- `docs/discord-control-bot/soc2-control-matrix.md`

## SOC 2 Readiness

The Discord companion bot is designed with SOC 2-aligned readiness controls. This is not a SOC 2 certification or report; formal SOC 2 compliance requires an independent CPA examination.

The branch includes a scheduled SOC 2 readiness workflow:

```text
.github/workflows/soc2-readiness-check.yml
```

It runs weekly, on manual dispatch, and on relevant PR/push changes. It checks required evidence documentation, read-only safety markers, adapter tests, bot tests, secret scanning, and scaffold validation.

Local readiness check:

```bash
node scripts/soc2-readiness-check.mjs
```

## Requirements

You do not need to be a Linux expert. Start with a fresh server and the installer will check the basics for you.

| What you need | Plain Explanation |
|---|---|
| A server | Ubuntu/Linux is the easiest path. Docker Desktop on Windows/WSL2 or a VM can also work. |
| Docker | You can start even if Docker is not ready yet. On supported Linux servers, the installer prepares Docker for you. |
| Funcom token | You will paste this into the browser setup wizard. |
| CPU support | The game server needs AVX/AVX2. Most modern dedicated servers and VPS plans expose this. |
| Disk space | 100 GB or more is recommended. |
| Web access | Open the Web UI on port `8088` from a private network, VPN, SSH tunnel, or a protected HTTPS reverse proxy. |

Memory Guide:

RAM decides how many Dune map servers you can keep running comfortably. Start with the basic layout if you are unsure. Add more RAM when you want more maps online at the same time or expect heavier player activity.

| Server Layout | Recommended RAM |
|---|---:|
| Basic server for getting started | 20 GB |
| Main world plus extra story/social maps | 30 GB |
| Main world, extra maps, and Deep Desert | 40 GB |
| Many always-on maps or heavier player activity | 60 GB+ |

Forward only the game ports for public/internet hosting:

| Port | Protocol | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `31982` | TCP | Game messaging |
| `7777-7810` | UDP | Game traffic |

Keep database, internal admin ports, and the Web UI private unless the Web UI is protected by HTTPS plus an access proxy. See [Public WebUI Security](docs/security-public-hosting.md) before hosting the console outside a trusted network.

## Getting Started

Copy and paste this on a fresh Linux server:

```bash
bash -c 'set -euo pipefail; if ! command -v curl >/dev/null 2>&1; then sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl tar; fi; mkdir -p "$HOME/dune-awakening-selfhost-docker"; cd "$HOME/dune-awakening-selfhost-docker"; latest_url="$(curl -fsSLI -o /dev/null -w "%{url_effective}" https://github.com/Red-Blink/dune-awakening-selfhost-docker/releases/latest)"; version="${latest_url##*/}"; curl -fsSL "https://github.com/Red-Blink/dune-awakening-selfhost-docker/archive/refs/tags/${version}.tar.gz" | tar -xz --strip-components=1; chmod +x install.sh; ./install.sh'
```

The installer downloads the latest release, prepares the server, starts the Web UI, and tells you what address to open in your browser. If you are on the same network as the server, use the same-network address. If you need remote administration, use a VPN or SSH tunnel for private HTTP access, or publish the Web UI only behind HTTPS and an access proxy.

## Community Addons

Dune Docker Console includes a Community Addons area for extra tools built by the community. Server owners can discover, install, enable, and remove addons from the Web UI without replacing the main console.

Addons are designed to let the community experiment with new panels, reports, helpers, and server-owner workflows while keeping the core console clean. Each addon declares what it needs before it is installed, so server owners can review permissions first.

Have an idea you want to build for Dune Docker Console? Start with the official addon template:

```text
https://github.com/Red-Blink/dune-docker-addon-template
```

The template gives addon developers a ready-to-use structure, examples, validation, and GitHub release packaging. Build your addon in its own repo, publish a release, then submit it to the community addons list when it is ready for others to try.

## Contributing & Project Notes

- Issues, fixes, and improvements are welcome.
- This project is community maintained and experimental.
- Funcom self-hosting behavior may change over time.
- Keep secrets, generated runtime files, and backups out of git.
- Do not expose the Web UI to untrusted users.
- The Discord companion bot remains read-only unless a future threat model and approval process explicitly changes that scope.
