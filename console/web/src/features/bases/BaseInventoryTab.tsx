            {/* Consolidated 2026-08-19 (per the UI/UX hat's dispatched design
                review, "Alternative A") from two separately-stacked
                panels -- one full combobox+quantity+button row for Give,
                a second, visually identical one for Fill -- into one
                shared item picker + quantity field with a Give/Fill mode
                toggle. A real operator reported the old two-panel layout as
                confusing, especially once Give and Fill were restricted to
                the same three item groups in this same session, making the
                two rows show identical candidate items with nothing
                explaining when to use which. The mode toggle IS that
                explanation now, and each mode's own secondary affordance
                (Give's batch queue, Fill's capacity sentinel) only renders
                while that mode is selected, instead of both being visible
                and competing for attention at once.

                CORRECTED 2026-08-19 (real regression, found the same day by
                a real operator): the consolidation above merged the INPUTS
                but never actually merged the NOTICES -- this block used to
                render three separate stacked <p> elements (an explanatory
                paragraph, the restart warning, and a Fill-only collision
                warning as its own second bordered box), directly
                recreating the "wall of similar-looking warning text"
                problem the very first design review diagnosed. Per a
                second dispatched UI/UX-hat review: shortened the always-
                shown explanatory line to a single muted caption (the mode
                toggle's own labels now carry most of that meaning), moved
                the toggle above the warning so the warning's own mode-
                dependent text change reads as caused by the toggle instead
                of appearing above it, and merged the restart warning and
                the Fill-only collision warning into ONE bordered banner --
                Fill mode appends a trailing sentence to the SAME element
                rather than opening a second, visually-identical box. Never
                more than two notice elements are visible at once now, in
                either mode (one caption line, one warning banner), down
                from three.

                CORRECTED 2026-08-19 (real operator report, same day):
                content-wise there were at most two notice elements, but
                the two prior passes above only ever addressed WHAT text
                renders and WHEN -- neither touched VISUAL TREATMENT, so
                the mode-hint (bare text, no border/padding/icon) and the
                warning banner (bordered, padded, iconed) sat directly
                above and below the same toggle with no shared visual
                language, reading as unpolished/thrown-together rather
                than deliberately designed. Per a third dispatched UI/UX-
                hat review: grouped the mode-hint and the toggle into one
                shared, lightly-bordered/padded container (neutral --border
                token, NOT the warning's amber --warning token, so this
                group reads as "low-weight information," not a second
                alert) -- eliminating the bare-text-sandwiched-between-two-
                bordered-things sequence entirely, while leaving the
                warning banner's own visual weight untouched, since it is
                correctly the one element in this panel that most needs to
                keep looking urgent. */}

            {/* Per INC-2026-07-31-001: the game engine claims dune.items rows
                only at server startup, so a given/filled item sits in the
                database but stays invisible in-game until the Survival
                server restarts. Silent and easy to rediscover the hard way
                -- surfaced explicitly here so an operator does not spend
                time re-litigating "why isn't this showing up" the way this
                fork's own incident history already did once. Restarting is
                not offered inline here (unlike the standalone Storage tab's
                "Apply Fills" button) -- Server Control/Bases already own
                that action, and duplicating a player-disconnecting restart
                trigger in a third place was judged a bigger risk than one
                extra tab switch. Applies to both modes, so the first
                sentence is always shown.

                The second sentence (per
                INC-2026-08-19-GIVE-FILL-POSITION-INDEX-COLLISION.md: while
                the map stays running, a filled row can land on the same
                slot a live in-game move/pickup claims at the same time,
                and the row that loses that race is never claimed on the
                next restart -- Give mitigates this by filling from the
                high end of the container, see nextHighPositionIndex in
                duneDb.js; Fill cannot use the same mitigation, since it is
                meant to top up toward real capacity, the same direction
                the engine already fills) is a Fill-specific ADDENDUM to
                this same restart-related warning, not an unrelated risk --
                appended as trailing text inside this SAME bordered banner
                only while Fill mode is selected, rather than rendered as a
                second, visually-identical box (the pre-2026-08-19 fix that
                caused a real operator to see "3 warnings" stacked in Fill
                mode). This is a documented, accepted limitation for Fill,
